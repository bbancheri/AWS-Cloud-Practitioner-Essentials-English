Summary
--
I really appreciate the way security is design : security groups deny by default all incorming traffic, the customer must open requested port (the purpose is to lead the customer to not open `any` posts). Inside the VPC, traffic is secure by Network access control lists (ACLs). Internet access, Virtual private Gateway, or Direct connect allow access to hosted ressources.\
Also, i discovers AWS DNS product : Route53. A part of this module introduce links between Route53 and CloudFront and EdgeLocation functionnality.
